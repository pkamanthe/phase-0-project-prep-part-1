# Software Engineering Prep Final Project Setup Part I: Setting Up Your Repo

## Learning Goals

- Set up your local and remote repositories for your final Software Engineering
  Prep project

## Introduction

Now that you've learned about Git version control, it's time to put your new
skills to use!

In the next section, as the final requirement for Software Engineering Prep,
you'll be creating a personal website! In this lesson, you'll get some practice
with Git and get set up for your final project at the same time.

Specifically, we'll go through the following steps:

- creating a local Git repository,
- creating a remote repository on GitHub,
- connecting the local and remote repos
- creating an initial commit, and
- pushing that work to the remote repo.

## Create Your Local Repo

Let's review the process for setting up your local repo. Follow along with the
steps below:

**1.** Choose a name for your project. You can call it anything you like - be
creative! For our example here, we'll use `my-personal-website`.

**2.** Make sure you're in the `Development/code` directory (or wherever you're
storing your code), then create your project directory and `cd` into it:

```console
$ mkdir my-personal-website
$ cd my-personal-website
```

**3.** Initialize the directory as a Git repo (make sure you've `cd`d into the
directory first):

```console
$ git init
```

**Check your work**: If you see the message "Initialized empty Git repository in
/Users/your-username/Development/code/your-directory-name/.git/", you have
successfully set up your directory as a Git repo.

The next step is to add some content.

## Create Some Content

Go ahead and open your new project in VS Code. From inside the
`my-personal-website` directory (or whatever you've named yours), type `code .`.
Next, create a README file:

```console
$ touch README.md
```

And add some content to it:

```console
$ echo "# My Personal Website" >> README.md
```

Of course, if you prefer, you can add the new file and content in VS Code
instead.

**A Note about README files**: The [README.md file][github-readme] is an
important piece of the documentation of your project. It is the first thing
people will see when they visit your repo on GitHub. Generally, as you build
your own projects, you'll want to get in the habit of [creating a good
README][makeareadme.com], including things like what your project does, how to
install and run the code, etc. While filling out the content in your README is
optional for the Software Engineering Prep project, you _will_ need to create
them for later projects. Check out the resources listed at the bottom of this
lesson to learn more.

**Check your work**: In VS Code, make sure the README.md file is present and
contains the header you just created before continuing with the instructions.

## Make Your Initial Commit

Now that we've created our project repo and added some content, it's time to
make our first commit. First, though, let's check the status of our repo:

```console
$ git status
```

You should see the following:

```console
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
  README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

This tells us that Git sees our new file but is not currently tracking it. So to
**add** it to the list of tracked files, then create our first commit, we'll
run:

```console
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
```

You should see something similar to this:

```console
[main (root-commit) d7c3189] Initial commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

> **Reminder**: We are not able to combine the `add` and `commit` commands in
> this case because the `README.md` file is not being tracked yet. We could,
> however, use `git add .` instead of spelling out the name of the file.

**Check your work**: If you saw the message shown above, you have successfully
made your first commit. You can also run `git status` to verify that there is
nothing to commit and the working tree is clean.

That's it! You now have your local repository created and set up to track your
changes. Now let's create a remote and connect our local repo to it.

## Create Your Remote Repo

To create a new GitHub repository, go to
[https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and sign in (if you aren't already
signed in). Then, click the **+** icon in the upper-right corner of the screen,
and choose 'New repository' in the drop-down menu.

![new repo drop down](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/project-prep-part-i/new-repo.png)

This will bring you to a page where you can give the new repository a name.
There will be some other settings as well, which we'll leave as they are:

![set new repo name](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/project-prep-part-i/set-new-repo-name.png)

Enter the same name you used for your local repo. (Note: you aren't required to
use the same name, but we recommend doing so to keep things simple.) Once the
repository is given a name, go ahead and click the "Create repository" button.

![create repo](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/project-prep-part-i/github-pages-create-repository.png)

An empty repository will be created.

## Add The New Remote To Your Local Repository

When you click "Create repository", you should be taken to a new page that
presents a set of different options for getting things started. It's worth
getting familiar with those options; each of them is helpful in different
circumstances.

Note that some of the commands shown here have information unique to the
repository and GitHub user. Your commands will differ slightly from the examples
because of this.

![setup page](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/project-prep-part-i/setup-page.png)

Which one of the options you choose will depend on your particular situation.
The first option is the one we used in the previous lesson:

![quick setup](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/project-prep-part-i/quick-setup.png)

We copied the URL and then used the `git remote add origin` command to connect
our local repo to the remote repo.

Let's take a look at the other options that are provided. The second option
listed should look like this:

![create repo on command line](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/project-prep-part-i/add-from-command-line.png)

This option contains a series of commands that you can copy and run in the
terminal, either one at a time or all together. However if you take a look at
the commands, you'll see that we've already done the first four:

1. `echo "# example-repository" >> README.md` creates a `README.md` file and
   adds some markdown
2. `git init` initializes a local repository in the folder you're currently in
   on the command line
3. `git add README.md` stages the newly created `README.md` file, getting it
   ready to be committed
4. `git commit -m "first commit"` creates the repository's first commit,
   preserving the newly created `README.md` file in the history of the
   repository

We don't want to repeat these commands, so let's move on to the next one:

![push existing repo](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/project-prep-part-i/push-existing-repo.png)

This option basically consists of the last three steps from the option above,
which is exactly what we want! In fact, if you take a closer look, you'll see
that two of the three commands are exactly what we ran in the last lesson! The
first three setup options listed are three different ways of doing the exact
same thing; GitHub is just providing the commands for us as a shortcut, so we
don't need to type them all out by hand.

Let's take a moment to review what each command does. As we mentioned above, two
of the three should look familiar:

1. `git remote add origin git@github...` adds a new remote — called `origin` —
   to the local repository and associates it with the remote repository.
2. `git branch -M main` is the only command you haven't learned about yet — it
   renames the current branch of your repository to `main`. (You should already
   be configured to use `main` as the default branch; if so, running this
   command is unnecessary. You can verify the name of your branch by running
   `git branch --show-current`.)
3. `git push -u origin main` pushes the initial commit we did earlier to the
   remote repository; the `u` flag sets `origin` as the default remote for the
   `main` branch.

Go ahead and run these commands — you can run them one at a time or all
together, as you prefer.

**Check your work**: When you run the commands above, the last thing you should
see is the line:

```console
"Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'."
```

You can also check in GitHub by going to the repo and refreshing the page; you
should see that the `README.md` file now appears on GitHub.

## Conclusion

That's it! Now that you've created both your remote and local repos and
configured Git to push to the `main` branch of your remote repo, you can start
working on your project. As you work, you should regularly commit your changes
and push them to GitHub with the following commands:

```console
git add .
git commit -m "Some meaningful commit message"
git push
```

Recall that you only need to run `git push -u origin main` the first time; the
`u` flag tells Git that you always want to push to `origin main`, so you only
need to run `git push` moving forward.

In the next lesson, we'll get you set up with the other files you'll need for
your project. You'll also learn how to deploy your new site to the Web using
GitHub Pages.
